# Monsters Attack (Java)

There are a bunch of monsters and other supernatural creatures who can attack each other and do (or not) some damage.

### Werewolf

- Werewolf is a type of monster.
- When a Werewolf attacks, it always inflicts the same amount of damage.
- When a Werewolf is hit, it always loses health.

### Vampire

- Vampire is a type of monster.
- When a Vampire attacks, it always inflicts the same amount of damage. However, there is a chance that, when it attacks, the vampire bites its enemy. When that happens, the vampire's health will increase a certain amount.
- When a vampire is hit, it always loses health.

### Mummy

- Mummy is a type of monster.
- A Mummy can only perform two consecutive attacks. If a Mummy tries to attack a third time, it fails, unrolls, and loses a certain amount of health. The attacking ability of the Mummy is then restored.
- When a Mummy is hit, it always loses health.

### Fairy

- The Fairy is a Supernatural being that attacks exactly like a Monster. However, it is not a monster.
- The Fairy can't be attacked by any monster, so it never loses health.

### Witch

- The Witch is a Supernatural being that attacks like a monster, but only suffers half of the damage caused by the enemy.
